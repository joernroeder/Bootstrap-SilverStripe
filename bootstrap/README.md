Twitter Bootstrap Theme for SilverStripe CMS
============================================

Twitter Bootstrap is a clean responsive theme that
will resize to fit smaller device profiles automatically.

This theme also includes the Basic Marketing site 
demonstrated on Bootstrap Examples with
a Hero unit as well as the Sidebar from the Fluid Layout
sample.

To use the Hero unit,

 1. Copy HeroPage.php and FeaturePage.php from 
    boostrap/code/ to mysite/code/

 2. Go to /dev/build?flush=all

 3. Go to /admin and create a Hero Page.

 4. The Page Name of the Hero page will be
    the large call to action, and the content
    will appear in the sub-head.

 5. Below the Hero page, add Feature Pages.

 6. Fill in the excerpt section of the Feature Pages
    to have them appear in the main Hero page.

 7. If you want this to be the home page,
    go to the Hero Page, click on the Metadata tab,
    and change the URL to /home
